# Authentication API
This is an authentication api which functions off of principles of the Diffie Hellman key exchange

With this authentication backend, you will not need to store any passwords, you will only server side secrets which are useless without the user secret and pin both of which are changed after every authentication.

## How it works
The authentication process is done by comparing a common secret hash (created by a user and server secret) to a user hash.

### Initial signup
A common secret is generated by a user and server secret using the diffie hellman key exchange.

Two sets of random strings of bytes are generated using /dev/urandom, these bytes are then converted to integers which are exponentiated in base 2 and in mod of a secure prime number, as such:

common_secret = 2<sup>(user_secret * server_secret)</sup>  mod  PRIME_MODULUS

The prime modulus is chosen from https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3526.txt (group id 14), however any secure diffie-hellman group can be chosen.

This common secret is then hashed and stored client side along with the user secret and can be protected behind a pin.

### Authentication process

The user secret and user hash are sent from the user and the common secret is calculated through diffie-hellman:

common_secret = 2<sup>(server_secret)</sup>  mod  PRIME_MODULUS  <sup>(user_secret)</sup>  mod PRIME_MODULUS
